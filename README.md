# PathMates

## Overview

PathMates is a University of Minnesota safety companion app designed to help students find and coordinate walks with others heading in the same direction, especially during late hours or in low-visibility conditions. The app ensures users are legitimate UMN students via university sign-in and provides real-time location, profile matching, messaging, and feedback features.

The app’s core goals are:

* **Safety** – Walk with verified UMN students instead of alone.
* **Coordination** – Easily arrange meeting points and routes.
* **Community** – Meet students with similar interests and build friendships.

3. **Profile Matching** – See profiles with preferences and initiate a walk.
4. **Live Walk Management** – Message or call walking partners during an active walk.
