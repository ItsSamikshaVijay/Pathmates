# PathMates

## Overview

PathMates is a University of Minnesota safety companion app designed to help students find and coordinate walks with others heading in the same direction, especially during late hours or in low-visibility conditions. The app ensures users are legitimate UMN students via university sign-in and provides real-time location, profile matching, messaging, and feedback features.

The app’s core goals are:

* **Safety** – Walk with verified UMN students instead of alone.
* **Coordination** – Easily arrange meeting points and routes.
* **Community** – Meet students with similar interests and build friendships.

## Key Features

1. **University Sign-In** – Secure login with UMN Internet ID and password to verify student status.
2. **User Discovery** – View nearby students heading in the same direction.
3. **Profile Matching** – See profiles with preferences and initiate a walk.
4. **Live Walk Management** – Message or call walking partners during an active walk.
5. **Feedback & Safety Controls** – Rate your walking experience, block, or report users.
6. **Real-Time Map** – See walking companions’ locations and routes to coordinate efficiently.
